          Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses
          objects and their interactions to design applications and computer
          programs. It is based on the concept of &quot;objects&quot;, which can
          contain data and code to manipulate that data. OOP languages, such as
          Java, provide built-in support for encapsulation, which is a
          fundamental concept in OOP.

          Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details of an
          object from the outside world, and only exposing a public interface
          for interacting with the object. This allows for greater control over
          how data is accessed and modified, and helps to protect the integrity
          of the data.

          For example, in Java, a class can be used to encapsulate the data and
          methods of an object. The data (also known as instance variables) can
          be made private, and accessed only through public methods (also known
          as getters and setters). This ensures that the data can only be
          modified in a controlled way, and that any changes made to the data
          are properly handled.

          Here is an example of encapsulation in Java:

        <pre
          id=\"ba4687a0-334b-46f8-8b9a-d955e363a218\"
          class=\"code\"
        ><code width=\"100%\">class BankAccount { private int balance; public void deposit(int amount) { balance += amount; } public void withdraw(int amount) { if (amount &lt;= balance) { balance -= amount; } else { System.out.println(&quot;Insufficient funds&quot;); } } public int getBalance() { return balance; } }</code></pre>
        <p id=\"44b66ca5-2888-4408-b323-baf20ee66544\" class=\"\">
          In this example, the class <code>BankAccount</code> encapsulates the
          data (balance) and methods (deposit, withdraw, getBalance) for a bank
          account. The balance is private and can only be accessed or modified
          through the public methods.
